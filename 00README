[JGF NetBeans project files for HPCUnit]
run_exp.sh: A shell script file to be used for the performance experiments.
log: The results of the performance experiements.  orig-All.txt and hu-All.txt lists the test execution time, the former generated from original benchmarks, and the latter from modified versions by HPCUnit.  The directories named seq, par and mpi contains the results of each benchmark application.
JGFTest: The NetBeans project files to test JGF benchmarks using HPCUnit.  Actual test cases for all benchmarks are located in JGFTest/src/jgftest.  For example, there are 3 files named CryptMPIRecipe.java  CryptParallelRecipe.java  CryptSequentialRecipe.java in JGFTest/src/jgftest/crypt.  
JGFSequentialSection1: The NetBeans project files to build the sequential JGF section1.
