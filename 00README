Artifacts data of the paper titled "Calculation Coverage Testing in
Scientific Applications".  The artifacts contains HPCUnit source and
executable code, and experimental data of JGF benchmarks for measuring
overheads incurred by HPCUnit.

[HPCUnit related files]
HPCUnit:         HPCUnit project files.  
                 Note that the source code and jar files are in the libs/HPCUnit directory.
libs:            Libraries used in HPCUnit.
logback.xml:     A log configuration file.

[JGF original files]
v2.0:            The sequential version of JGF benchmarks
threadv1.0:      The parallel version of JGF benchmarks
MPJv1.0:         The distributed version of JGF benchmarks
Data:            Input data for JGF benchmarks


[JGF NetBeans project files for HPCUnit]
run_exp.sh:           A shell script file to be used for the performance experiments.

To type
# java -cp JGFTest/dist/JGFTest-noaspect.jar jgf.sequential.JGFCryptBenchSizeC
for normal exectuion, and 
# java -cp JGFTest/dist/JGFTest.jar jgf.sequential.JGFCryptBenchSizeC
for execution with HPCUnit logging.

Finally, you can do calculation coverage testing by launching each HPCUnit test case via the JUnit test runner:
# java -cp JGFTest/dist/JGFTest-tests.jar:JGFTest/dist/JGFTest.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore jgftest.CryptTest 

log:                  The results of the performance experiements.  
                      orig-All.txt and hu-All.txt lists the test execution time, the former 
                      generated from original benchmarks, and the latter from modified versions by HPCUnit.  
                      The directories named seq, par and mpi contains the results of each benchmark application.
JGFTest:              The NetBeans project files to test JGF benchmarks using HPCUnit.  
                      Actual test cases for all benchmarks are located in JGFTest/src/jgftest.  
                      For example, there are 3 files named CryptMPIRecipe.java, CryptParallelRecipe.java and 
                      CryptSequentialRecipe.java in JGFTest/src/jgftest/crypt.
